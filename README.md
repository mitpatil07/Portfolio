- **Contact Form**: Allows visitors to get in touch with me.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The main JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For structuring and styling the webpage.
- **React Router**: For handling routing within the site.
- **Bootstrap** (or Tailwind CSS, if used): For responsive layout and UI components.
- **EmailJS** (or other service, if applicable): For handling form submissions and contact requests.
